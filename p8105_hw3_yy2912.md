\#question 1: load instacart data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 rows and 15 columns in data ‘instacart’. There are 134
distinct aisel. Some key variables include 131209 distinct order\_id and
131209 distinct user\_id.

\#question 1: how many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most
items ordered from?

``` r
numberof_aisle=
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(n=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles and most items are orderd from “fresh vegetables”.

\#question 1: make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered

``` r
plot_aisle =
  numberof_aisle %>%
  filter(n>10000)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=n))
plot_aisle+geom_point()+theme(
          legend.position="none") +
  xlab("Aisle")+
  ylab("The number of items ordered") +
  ggtitle("The number of items ordered in each aisle")
```

\#question 1: make a table showing the three most popular items in each
of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in
your table.

``` r
popular_item=
  instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients","dog food care","packaged vegetables fruits"))%>%
  group_by(aisle,product_name)%>%
  summarize(
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
 group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    rank=max(n))
```

\#question 1: make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which
Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the
week.

``` r
mean_hour=
  instacart %>%
  filter(product_name==c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream"))%>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow)%>%
  summarize(mean_hour=mean(order_hour_of_day))
```

    ## Warning in product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream"):
    ## longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
